# Optical-Communication-Networks

1. Implemented the k shortest path routing algorithm in Python using Dijkstra's algorithm.
2. Minimize the usage of certain links
   A) Print the maximum usage of any link between nodes that was used.
   B) Print the minimum usage of any link between nodes that was used.
   C) Print the average usage of all the links between nodes that were used.
4. Wavelength assignment using:
  A) Random Algorithm: Selects a wavelength randomly.
  B) First-Fit Algorithm: Selects the first available wavelength.
  C) Least-Used Algorithm: Selects the least used wavelength.
